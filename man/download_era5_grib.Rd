\arguments{
\item{shape}{sf object; shapefile or spatial object to download data for.}

\item{lat}{numeric; latitude}

\item{lon}{numeric; longitude}

\item{buffer}{numeric; buffer around the point in degrees. Default is 0.1.}

\item{variable}{vector of ERA5 variable names e.g.
"2m_temperature", "total_precipitation". Default variables are:
"10m_u_component_of_wind", "10m_v_component_of_wind",
"2m_dewpoint_temperature", "2m_temperature", "snowfall",
"surface_pressure", "surface_solar_radiation_downwards",
"surface_thermal_radiation_downwards", "total_precipitation".}

\item{year}{numeric; year or vector of years.}

\item{month}{numeric; month or vector of months. Defaults to 1:12.}

\item{site}{string of site name which will be appended to the file}

\item{user}{user (email address) used to sign up for the ECMWF data service,
if only a single user is needed it defaults to ("ecmwfr").}

\item{era5_dataset}{string; of which ERA5 dataset to use. Can be 'reanalysis-era5-single-levels' or 'reanalysis-era5-land'}

\item{path}{filepath to store downloaded file}
