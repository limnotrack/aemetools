# Plot calibration results

Plot calibration results

## Usage

``` r
plot_calib(
  calib,
  fit_col = "fit",
  nrow = 2,
  base_size = 8,
  return_pars = FALSE,
  log_y = TRUE,
  na_value = deprecated()
)
```

## Arguments

- calib:

  A list with the calibration results loaded using
  [`read_calib`](read_simulation_output.md).

- fit_col:

  character; name of column containing fit values. Default is `"fit"`.

- nrow:

  integer; number of rows in plot

- base_size:

  numeric; base size for theme

- return_pars:

  logical; return parameter values

- log_y:

  logical; use log scale on y-axis. Default is `TRUE`.

- na_value:

  **\[deprecated\]** Numeric. Penalty value substituted for `NA` fit
  values, this is no longer needed as NA values are now written to
  simulation_data in output of calib_aeme() and sa_aeme(). The argument
  will be removed in a future version.

## Value

list of plots
